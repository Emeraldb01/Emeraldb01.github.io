    <h1>My Thoughts on "The Parable of Google Flu: Traps in Big Data Analysis"</h1>
    <h3>By Nai-Syuan Chang | October 2025</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        I’ve always seen Big Data as both useful and a little unsettling. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Its potential feels limitless, but so do the risks. I’d thought a lot about bias and ethics in data collection before, less so about who actually gets access to those datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
        From my own experience training models, most data researchers seem preoccupied with whether their data truly capture what matters, and whether their predictions actually reflect reality. A small oversight in collection or tuning can snowball into huge distortions later. It’s a reminder that meaningful research demands more than technical skill,  it takes self-awareness and humility.
    </p>
    <p>
        Reading The Parable of Google Flu really reinforced that. The story shows how “more data” doesn’t always mean 
        “better data.” One example stuck with me: a model trained on every available search term performed worse than 
        one using a smaller, cleaner subset. I’ve seen firsthand how messy data can bury insights under 
        noise. The piece also made me think about how even accurate data can miss the human side. Just because you can 
        track how long coworkers spend together doesn’t mean you understand their friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another theme that stood out was commercialization. Big Data isn’t just for science, it’s the fuel behind 
        advertising, insurance, and policing. I thought about Flock cameras that track vehicle movements and share 
        that data with both police and private firms, or about Walmart quietly gathering facial, purchase, and 
        behavioral data on everyone who walks in. The line between “insight” and “surveillance” feels thinner than 
        ever.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then there’s how algorithms shape the very data they learn from. The reading described Google’s search 
        engine changing user behavior, which in turn changes its training data, a feedback loop. The same thing 
        happens on social media. Algorithms amplify outrage because it drives engagement, creating echo chambers 
        that reinforce division. Media outlets often make it worse by spotlighting the most extreme voices and 
        calling them representative.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, the question of access hit me hardest. Today, the biggest datasets and GPUs sit behind paywalls
        ,  owned by large corporations or elite universities. Smaller institutions are left out. In the age of 
         generative AI, this imbalance feels even more dangerous. When only a few players can afford to build 
         and train models, we risk deepening the very inequities we hope technology will solve.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the end, The Parable of Google Flu is a reminder that data alone isn’t knowledge. Scale can’t replace 
        context. Algorithms can magnify our blind spots as easily as they reveal patterns. Responsible data 
        science isn’t just about predicting outcomes, it’s about deciding which questions are worth asking in 
        the first place.
