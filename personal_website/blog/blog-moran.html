    <h1>Guest Lecture Reflections: Mark Moran, Bayer Crop Sciences</h1>
    <h3>By Nai-Syuan Chang | September 2025</h3>
    <br>

    <p>
        This reflection is part of <strong>CS 598 Digital Agriculture</strong>, a course taught by <strong>Dr. John F. Reid</strong>, formerly from John Deere.  
        In this class, we study the current landscape of agricultural technology ,  from autonomous machinery to digital sensing, biotech, and sustainability.  
        This week’s guest speaker, <strong>Dr. Mark Moran</strong> from <strong>Bayer Crop Sciences</strong>, previously worked at John Deere as well, giving him a rare dual perspective across two key sides of the farming industry.  
        Deere focuses on <strong>OEM equipment</strong> such as tractors and autonomous systems, while Bayer ,  formerly Monsanto ,  focuses on <strong>inputs</strong> like seeds, fertilizers, and crop protection.  
        Dr. Moran’s experience across both companies offered a nuanced view of how technology, biology, and data science intersect to shape the future of agriculture.
    </p>

    <p>
        In his lecture, Dr. Moran introduced a new perspective on digital agriculture ,  biotechnology.  
        Biotech tackles farming challenges from a biological and chemical standpoint: modifying seeds to increase yield, creating fertilizers that enhance growth, and developing weed killers that are safer for the environment.  
        But what stood out to me was how much <strong>computer science</strong> underpins these breakthroughs.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, in the protein folding problem, scientists once spent weeks or months predicting how a protein would take shape.  
        With the help of computational models inspired by natural language processing, computers can now predict most known protein structures efficiently.  
        This advancement has accelerated genetic modification and chemical discovery in agriculture ,  lowering input costs and increasing output, reshaping how innovation happens in farming.
    </p>

    <p>
        Earlier in the course, we discussed how agriculture is high risk, where a single failed harvest can devastate a farmer’s livelihood.  
        In contrast, Dr. Moran described agricultural machinery as low risk: the worst a self-driving tractor might do is stop in the middle of a field.  
        Unlike urban vehicles, farm machinery can safely halt and wait for human input.  
        This difference changes how autonomy is developed, tested, and trusted in agricultural contexts.
    </p>

    <p>
        Dr. Moran also shared a “pyramid of work”: at the base is manual labor, above it repetitive work, then pattern recognition, and at the top, creative thinking.  
        Each technological wave ,  the steam engine, the computer, AI ,  automates a layer of that pyramid.  
        Yet humans remain essential for generating new ideas and breakthroughs.  
        This idea resonated with me deeply: technology doesn’t replace us; it amplifies what we can achieve.
    </p>

    <p>
        One internal conflict I felt during the talk was about competing goals in AgTech.  
        Biotech innovations aim to make seeds stronger and easier to grow, while machinery advancements often aim to use fewer inputs and lower costs.  
        Aren’t these goals in tension?  
        Dr. Moran acknowledged that they are ,  but both take over a decade to reach production, and progress depends on what innovations emerge next.  
        This made me think about sustainable business models that can balance both sides without exploiting consumers.
    </p>

    <p>
        The story that struck me most was when Dr. Moran described introducing a self-driving tractor to a farmer.  
        The developer saw it as a tool to boost productivity and profit.  
        The farmer thought for a moment and said, “With this technology, I can finally go to the football game with my son.”  
        That moment reframed everything ,  technology isn’t just about efficiency or revenue; it’s about giving people back time and improving their quality of life.
    </p>

    <p>
        In summary, Dr. Moran expanded my view of agricultural technology to include biotechnology ,  a field deeply tied to chemistry, biology, and AI.  
        From the history of Bayer to the protein folding problem, his talk illustrated how interdisciplinary innovation drives both competition and collaboration in modern farming.  
        It reminded me that at its best, technology doesn’t just make farming smarter ,  it makes life better.
